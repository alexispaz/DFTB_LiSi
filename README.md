# Content

The `crystal/` folder contains the crystal structures used to train the
model, according to the procedure described in the main publication.

The `amorphous/` folder contains the amorphous structures used to
validate the model, as explained in the main work.

The `lisi/` folder contains the `.skf` files for Li-Li, Li-Si and Si-Si
corresponding to the parameter set B, as described in the main publication.
